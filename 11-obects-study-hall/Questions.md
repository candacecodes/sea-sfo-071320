# Objects Review

### Questions: 
- How to use/call/debug with pry
- Gain a better understanding of how you can test your own code.
    - without rspec
- joiner `@@all`, is there an easier way to loop through them all. 
- how to do you chain that data, how do you chain methods
    - instance methods vs call methods, when calling those methods.
- preferrable to use enumerable vs looping/while/if.else?
    - for now enumerables are prefferred.
- How to pull a particular set of data from the array ( from `@@all` )
    - what if I just want one thing(attribute)
- block syntax in the join ( for the enumerables ). 
    - what goes in between in the block.
